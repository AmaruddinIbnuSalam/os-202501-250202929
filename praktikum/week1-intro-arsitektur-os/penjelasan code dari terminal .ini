Looks like you pasted the very beginning of a Linux kernel boot log — specifically from WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2).

Here’s what’s happening in your snippet:

Linux version 6.6.87.2-microsoft-standard-WSL2
→ This tells us the kernel version (6.6.87.2) and that it’s the Microsoft-patched kernel for WSL2. It was compiled with GCC 11.2.0 and Binutils 2.37.

Command line:

initrd=\initrd.img WSL_ROOT_INIT=1 panic=-1 nr_cpus=10 hv_utils.timesync_implicit=1 console=hvc0 debug pty.legacy_count=0 WSL_ENABLE_CRASH_DUMP=1


→ Kernel boot parameters:

initrd=\initrd.img → Initial RAM disk.

WSL_ROOT_INIT=1 → Tells WSL this is the root Linux init process.

panic=-1 → Don’t reboot on kernel panic.

nr_cpus=10 → Limit to 10 CPUs.

hv_utils.timesync_implicit=1 → Enable Hyper-V time sync.

console=hvc0 → Use the hypervisor console.

WSL_ENABLE_CRASH_DUMP=1 → Enable crash dumps inside WSL.

KERNEL supported cpus:
It lists the CPU vendors it knows how to handle: Intel and AMD.

BIOS-provided physical RAM map:
These are E820 memory map entries, which describe which regions of memory are usable vs reserved:

0x0000000000000000-0x000000000009ffff usable (first 640 KB RAM).

0x00000000000e0000-0x00000000000e0fff reserved.

0x0000000000100000-0x00000000001fffff ACPI data (system config).

0x0000000000200000-0x00000000f7ffffff usable (main system RAM).

This is the very early boot stage of the kernel, before it has even mounted the root filesystem.

Do you want me to give you a line-by-line detailed breakdown of this whole boot log, or just a high-level summary of what WSL2 is doing here?
